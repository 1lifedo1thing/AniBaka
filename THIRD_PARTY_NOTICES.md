## media_kit_video Windows bridge

- Package: `media_kit_video`, resolved through pub Git dependencies
- Fork: <https://github.com/AniBakaBaka/media-kit>
- Upstream: <https://github.com/media-kit/media-kit>
- License: MIT

The fork retains the upstream history and carries AniBaka's Windows renderer
under `media_kit_video/windows/anibaka/`. AniBaka opts into that renderer and
provides its native GPU backend. The package's license is also installed in
the Windows application's `data/licenses/media_kit_video_windows/` directory.

## screen_brightness compatibility package

- Package: `screen_brightness`, resolved through pub Git dependencies
- Fork: <https://github.com/AniBakaBaka/screen_brightness>
- Upstream interface: <https://github.com/aaassseee/screen_brightness>
- Copyright: Copyright (c) 2021 Jack Liu
- License: MIT

The fork preserves the upstream Dart API while omitting the Windows dependency
and plugin registration. Its license text is included in the package. Both
forks are pinned to commits in `pubspec.yaml` and `pubspec.lock`.
